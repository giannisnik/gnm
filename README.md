# Graph Neural Machine: A New Model for Learning with Tabular Data

This repository is the official implementation of [Graph Neural Machine: A New Model for Learning with Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02862.pdf).

## Requirements

Code is written in Python 3.11 and requires:
* PyTorch 2.1
* Scikit-learn 1.3
* Pandas 2.0

## Datasets

The datasets are automatically downloaded when the user executes the script


## Training and Evaluation

To train and evaluate the model, specify the dataset and the hyperparameters in the main.py file and then execute:

```
python main.py
```
